This is a simple C# Application that connects to a web camera device and displays a window when ever motion is detected. It was intended to be a "Rear View Mirror" in my cubical so people wouldn't sneak up on me anymore. 

I simply developed the front end. The original motion detection was designed by Andrew Kirillov <andrew.kirillov@gmail.com> and uses Image filters from the open source AForge.NET library. His project can be found at the following:
